Here's how the project's organized
	and how to use the client-side of the framework:

- All the configs are located at __NetworkingConfig script
- oClient initiates the connection
- When oClient gets a packet, it passes it to handlePacket() function,
  which you can modify
- send() sends the specified data (in struct format) to server
- you can write simple wrappers for outcoming signals and put those into SendStuff script
  e.x. you can replace `send({cmd: "hello", msg: "world"})` with `sendHello()`
  please make all of the commands lower-case


TL;DR:
- handle input in *handlePacket.gml* script
- send things to the server using *send()*
- write custom wrappers for send() in *sendStuff.gml*
- change ip/port in *__NetworkingConfig* (or input it in-game somehow)
- don't worry about internal stuff too much

- best practice would to define all your
  sending functions in SendStuff script,
  even tho you can just send() things directly
